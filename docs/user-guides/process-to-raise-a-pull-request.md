# Process to raise a pull request


Pull request from developer's point of view.

It is recommended to create a new branch in developer's local github repository for working on new code changes/features .
Once developer's code change has completed the developer should make a pull request to any other [contributor's](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/network/members) 
recommended branch to test the code out based on the [checklist](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/blob/master/docs/KOBman%20Script%20Review%20Checklist.md) . The contributor merge this isolated code to local branch
and tests out the functionalty,do a thorough review based on the [checklist provided by the team hyperledgerkochi](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/blob/master/docs/KOBman%20Script%20Review%20Checklist.md). Once the the contributor feels like the code is reliable ,
they should provide a LGTM approval in the hyperledgerkochi/KOBman's [pull section](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman/pulls). Only then the code get merged to hyperledgerkochi/KOBman's github [master repository](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBman).




A developer/contributor is recommeded to follow the listed steps , for successful merge of their code pull requests. 

**step 1:** For avoiding future merge conflicts sync your master repository with hyperledgerkochi/master (eg :hyperledgerkochi/master - > EtricKombat/master)

**step 2:** Sync you local master branch with remote branch (recommended)

**step 3:** create a new branch from synced master branch with assigned (optional eg: RF-xxxx ) 

**step 4:** sync you local branch with remote branch (recommended)

PULL REQUEST - of Code reviewer (pov: code reviewer/contributor)


**step 1:** make a pull request to any other contributer for code review/testing , (subject : has to be DOCUMENTATION OF getting started ), (template should edited)
**step 2:** merge the pull request to new_branch created (synced with hyperledgerkochi/master )
**step 3:** once merged need to test it out by releasing a local version and install/test kob utility from the code reviewers local system.
**step 4:** if the functionality is working as expected , do thorough code review based on [link : checklist ] 
**step 5:** finally if the code passes the checklist , give a LGTM approval ( hence the same pull request to hyperledgerkochi/master can merged)
